			<div class="animateH"><h1>About SG's Public buses</h1></div>
			<div class="animate"><p>Singapore's modern public bus system is run by 4 operators - SBS Transit, SMRT, Tower Transit
			and Go-Ahead Singapore. All of the public bus system is owned and designed by LTA under the Bus
			Contracting Model(BCM) which is why newer buses are now under a unified Lush Green livery. 
			The 4 different operators bid for bus route packages to operate the bus services under each package 
			and will be paid service fees with bonuses and penalties depending on their performance.</p></div>
			
			<div class="animate"><p>The roles of bus operators under the BCM is to operate services under their packages with 
			specified performance standards, maintain their bus fleet, depots and interchanges, collect fares on
			behalf of the governmen and provide bus service information and customer management services.</p></div>
			
			<div class="animateH"><h1>Why the Bus Contracting Model?</h1></div>
			<div class="animate"><p>The BCM allows the 4 operators in SG to focus more on operations and meeting service standards and allows
			LTA to respond quickly to any changes in service demands. It also allows for market competition which 
			encourages operators to provide better bus services for commuters - through more reliable bus services 
			with less waiting time between buses. This contract model is also seen in places like London and certain
			Australian cities.</p></div>

					<div class="animateS"><h1>Basic Bus Services</h1></div>
					<div class="animate"><p>Basic bus services in SG consists of Trunk and Feeder services. Trunk
					services are long bus routes that connect multiple towns across SG, or connect multiple towns
					with the city area. Feeder services on the other hand, operate around neighbourhoods in a town
					to connect to various parts of housing estates with bus interchanges and MRT stations.</p></div>

				<div class="Svcs" id="cityPg">
					<div class="animateS"><h1>City Direct Services</h1></div>
					<div class="animate"><p>City Direct services in SG are bus routes that connect residential estates
					with the Central Business District(CBD). These services operate only during peak hours and have
					set boarding and alighting points - passengers can only board at residential stops in the morning
					and CBD stops in the evening and can only alight at residential stops in the evening and CBD stops
					in the morning. These services charge fares similar to that of express services.</p></div>

				<div class="Svcs" id="expressPg">
					<div class="animateS"><h1>Express Services</h1></div>
					<div class="animate"><p>Express bus services are services that have express sectors, either by skipping
					bus stops or travelling on expressways. This saves travel time compared to taking regular trunk services.
					However, they do charge higher fares due to the added convenience. Express services can be classified in
					3 groups - Full Day, Limited-Stop and CBD express services. Full Day express services connects residential
					areas to the city or between towns, Limited-stop express services follow their parent route but stops at
					fewer bus stops on the route and CBD express services are similar to City Direct services, except that
					there are no set boarding and alighting points and passengers are free to board or alight at any stop along
					the route.</p></div>

				<div class="Svcs" id="premiumPg">
					<div class="animateS"><h1>Premium Services</h1></div>
					<div class="animate"><p>Premium services are similar to City Direct services by connecting residential areas 
					with work areas like the CBD, business parks and industrial areas. However, they use private coach buses and
					are charged a flat fare ranging from $3 to $6 which makes Premium services more expensive than regular public
					transport but cheaper than taxis or private hire vehicles.</p></div>

					<div class="animate"><p>Single Deckers are the most common type of public bus in SG with over 3,300 of them.
					These buses are usually 12 metres in length with 2 axles and 2 doors(newer models have 3 doors) with a single floor.

					with only 40 of them left. They can mostly be found in areas such as Choa Chu Kang, Woodlands and Yishun. 
					The only bendy bus model in SG left is the MAN A24 bus, which is 18 metres long with 3 axles and 3 doors. These buses

				<div class="Buses" id="doublePg">
					<div class="animateS"><h1>Double Deckers</h1></div>
					<div class="animate"><p>Double deckers in SG have become even more commonplace today due to many double decker buses
					being ordered to replace old bendy buses operated by SMRT as well as to increase fleet capacity. There are around
					2,500 of them operating across the island today. These buses are usually 12 metres in length with 3 axles and 2
					doors(newer models have 3 doors) with 2 floors. The bottom deck is able to carry both seating and standing passengers
					while the top deck is only able to carry seating passengers due to safety concerns and a low roof height. Double
					deckers have a capacity of around  139 passengers at full load, suitable for routes with high demand.</p></div>

			<div class="animate"><p>Singapore's MRT system first opened in 1987 with a section of the North-South Line in the city.
			Today, there are 140 stations across 6 MRT lines and over 200km of track. The MRT system is operated by SMRT and SBS
			Transit. SMRT operates the North-South, East-West, Circle and Thomson-East Coast Lines while SBS Transit operates the 
			North-East and Downtown Lines. The entirety of the MRT network is either elevated or underground with mobile data
			services across the entire network.</p></div>

					<div class="animateS"><h1>North-South Line</h1></div>
					<div class="animate"><p>The North-South Line(NSL) is the first MRT line to open in Singapore in 1987. The
					first section of the line to open was between Yio Chu Kang and Toa Payoh. Today, it runs 45 kilometres with
					27 stations from Jurong East to Marina South Pier via Woodlands. Trains on the NSL run a 6-car formation with 4
					doors per car. Since 2019, the NSL has upgraded its signalling system to have automatic train operations. Several
					other improvements have been made to the line since its opening, with platform screen doors being installed
					at overground stations, new stations like Canberra and introduction of new rolling stocks to increase capacity 
					and replace older models.</p></div>

					City Hall to Outram Park. Today, it is the longest MRT line in SG at 57.2 kilometres long with 35 stations from
					Pasir Ris to Tuas Link and a branch line from Tanah Merah to Changi Airport. Trains and equipment on the EWL are
					similar to that of the NSL and has fully automatic train operations as well. There used to be trains that ran direct 
					from Boon Lay to Changi Airport but the Changi branch line was converted to a shuttle service due to low ridership.
					Today, trains run from Pasir Ris to Joo Koon, with every few westbound trains terminating at Tuas Link instead.</p></div>

					<div class="animateS"><h1>North-East Line</h1></div>
					<div class="animate"><p>The North-East Line(NEL) is SG's third MRT line, opening in 2003. At 20 kilometres long
					with 16 stations from Punggol to HarbourFront, it is SG's shortest MRT line. The line is famous for being the world's
					first fully-automated underground driverless heavy rail line. Trains on the NEL are powered by overhead wires and
					run 6 car formations with 4 doors per car. In terms of development, there is currently an extension from Punggol
					to Punggol Coast which is under construction and is expected to open in 2024. 2 stations - Buangkok and Woodleigh were
					opened in 2006 and 2011 respectively to serve the increased demand due to developments in the area. Stations on the 
					line are wheelchair-accessible and most of them are Civil Defence shelters which can withstand airstrikes and

					the circle line will finally be a complete loop with the line being connected from HarbourFront to Marina Bay with 
					3 stations in between. The line is 35.5 kilometres long with 30 stations currently. The line is similar to that of 
					the NEL in that it is both completely automated and fully underground. However, trains draw power from a third rail 
					and are only 3 cars long with 4 doors each car.</p></div>

					like the NEL and CCL and trains on the DTL run 3 car formations with 4 doors each car. There are currently plans to
					extend the line from Expo to connect it with the Thomson-East Coast line at Sungei Bedok and is expected to be 
					completed in 2025. Hume station would also be opened by 2025 to serve Hillview residents and an extension from Bukit
